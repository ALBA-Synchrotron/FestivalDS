FestivalDS - Text to speech tango device server using festival speech synthesis

This device server can play speech voice messages from a given text by using the festival speech synthesis system.
It has been tested in suse 11.1, suse 12.1 and (with minor modifications) in debian 9

IMPORTANT NOTES:

1) The user that runs the device server must be added to "audio" group.

2) The device can't play sounds if the audio device is in use. Fortunately, there's a solution for this (see http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1270069).
The DS should execute this command (note it includes padsp): "echo "play a sound" | padsp festival --tts"
