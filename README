FestivalDS - Text to speech tango device server using festival speech synthesis

This device server can play speech voice messages from a given text by using the festival speech synthesis system.
It has been tested in suse 11.1, suse 12.1 and (with minor modifications) in debian 9

IMPORTANT NOTES:

1) The user that runs the device server must be added to "audio" group.

2) The device can't play sounds if the audio device is in use. Fortunately, there's a solution for this (see http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1270069).
The DS should execute this command (note it includes padsp): "echo "play a sound" | padsp festival --tts"

3) PopUp requires some setup to work. You need "libnotify-bin" to be installed in your machine. You also need the user running the device server to be able to execute "notify-send" as the user who is going to receive the pop up (this can be done by properly setting up sudoers). You will probably need to customize the command to show pop ups (accesible as a property of the device server)
